After a long wait, I've finally done it.  

These are the PCBs you're looking for.   

Introducing Jangofet, Bobafet, & Ailynfet. 

It's an image heavy readme, so buckle up.  

Jangofet is a Flex cable that works on either v1 or v2  
Now this might be expensive to have made, But you will only need one cable, not 2.

Assembled boards can be ordered for around $75 for 25 of them, so like $3 a cable. The final price depends on the cost of parts. 
Uses 2x [IRFHS8342PbF](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/irfhs8342pbf.pdf?fileId=5546d462533600a401535623992e1f5f).

Because of the cost of flexible pcbs and having them assembled for you(if you don’t want to hand assemble), I have also created Bobafet; a little 10mmX10mm pcb to achieve the same task.  
Each board is technically 2 boards, JLCPCB wont assemble anything under 10x10mm so it is partially drilled in half so it still only counts as one.

Assembled boards can be ordered for around $20 for 25 of them, so like $0.80 a board. The final price depends on the cost of parts.

Because mosfets can be pricey and so can getting pcbs made, I have also created Sintasfet; a little 10mmX10mm pcb to achieve the same task.  
It's desinged for the PDFN3x3 footprint and for mosfets strong enough to be used alone like the [TM80N03DF](https://www.lcsc.com/datasheet/lcsc_datasheet_2411121145_Tritech-MOS-TM80N03DF_C7463225.pdf).  
Each board is technically 2 boards, JLCPCB wont assemble anything under 10x10mm so it is partially drilled in half so it still only counts as one. 
Going off the specs this should work solo, I have some on their way to me now to personally test. So don't order yet

Because of the cost of flexible pcbs and having them assembled for you(if you don’t want to hand assemble), & so you can use a different mosfet. I have also created Ailynfet; a little 10mmX10mm pcb to achieve the same task.  
The min board size Jlcpcb will assemble is 10x10 so you may have to file it down a little.  
I have also kept the holes all the same size on the larger end, so it’s cheaper to manufacture.  
Ailynfet can be used with 2 mosfets.  
The footprint is for the [TPN8R903NL](https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/info/TPN8R903NL_datasheet_en_20140218.pdf?did=14026&prodName=TPN8R903NL). 
With all four of the boards I kept cost in mind while designing them.

I've included all the files, not just the Gerbers. It isn't really open if all you give is the Gerbers.  



My license is, just give credit which is as simple as leaving the QR code as it links to this repo. I didn't do this to make money, I did this for the community.  
Thanks to stashboy for taking measurements for me because my calipers were dead.


Now with all the cool stuff out of the way here comes the dumb stuff. Ordering prototypes is fairly expensive. the pcbs themselves are not too expensive, but the parts add up quick. So if you would like to help with current/future projects here is my [paypal](https://paypal.me/pbanj) this will help get pcbs done faster.

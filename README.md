After a long wait, I've finally done it.  

These are the PCBs you're looking for.   

Introducing Jangofet and Bobafet. 

It's an image heavy readme, so buckle up.  

Jangofet is a Flex cable that works on either v1 or v2  
Now this might be expensive to have made, But you will only need on cable, not 2.

Assembled boards can be ordered for around $75 for 25 of them, so like $3 a cable. The final price depends on the cost of parts. 

Because of the cost of flexible pcbs and having them assembled for you(if you don’t want to hand assemble), I have also created Bobafet; a little 10mmX10mm pcb to achieve the same task. The min board size Jlcpcb will assemble is 10x10 so you may have to file it down a little. I have also kept the holes all the same size on the larger end, so it’s cheaper to manufacture. With both I kept cost in mind while designing them.

Assembled boards can be ordered for around $20 for 25 of them, so like $0.80 a board. The final price depends on the cost of parts. 


I've included all the files, not just the Gerbers. It isn't really open if all you give is the Gerbers.  



My license is, just give credit which is as simple as leaving the QR code as it links to this repo. I didn't do this to make money, I did this for the community.  
Thanks to stashboy for taking measurements for me because my calipers were dead.
